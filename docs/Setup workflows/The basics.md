# Abstract
We will set up folders, create a graph of notes, refactor it, and try out canvas.
## Set up folder structure
- Files.
- References
- "Notes" or "Zettelkasten"
- Templates
Then,
1. Settings -> Files and Links -> Default location for new notes: set it to "Notes" or "Zettelkasten".
2. Settings -> Files and Links -> Default location for new attachements: "In the folder specified below": Set to "Files".
## Create a graph of notes
Remember: Cmd+p to search for actions.
1. Create four notes and link them as in the drawing. Then organize them by both project and content.
