# Abstract
Make editing in Obsidian blazingly fast.
# Instructions
1. Settings -> Editor -> Advanced -> Vim key bindings
2. Community plugin: "Scroll offset". Options: set distance "200" (or to preference).
3. Vimrc Support: create a .obsidian.preamble.sty file. Here is [my file for example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mscott99/matthewscott-blog/main/files/.obsidian.vimrc). It is highly personalized and without much explanation, use at your own peril.
	- To see which obcommands are available, write ":obcommand" in normal mode, then Ctrl+Alt+I to see the console. All available commands will be printed there.
