## "Just do the work, not the workflow"
### Addressing the haters
- Up-front cost for recurring returns; avoid repetitive organizational work.
- Automated organizational work.
- Existence of free productivity improvements.
- Frictionless work is fun!

## Guiding principles

|          |     |                                                                         |
| -------: | --: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| maximize |     | writing quality and quantity                                            |
|     s.t. |     | Chaotic idea generation, change of research direction and new insights. |

### So either
1. Just be a better researcher (yes, but also?)
2. Reduce waste and maximize re-use

# Chapter 1: the problem
---
## Waste
Workflows fail through waste!
- Not writing things down: "I'll probably remember it".
	- It is difficult: high friction.
	- No system to store the knowledge
		- Example: storing a connection between ideas, a form of knowledge.
- Cannot find what was written down: poor organization.
	- Context switching
- Mental overhead: your ram is limited.
---
## Contexts: artificial walls
Contexts include
- Research project
- Source: Course, paper, reading group. 
- Degree of polish
- Writing structure
- Time
- Team
---
## Consequences of waste
- Re-understanding
- Re-proving
- Re-writing.
---
## Bonus: other goals of writing workflows
- Clarification of ideas.
- Learning through writing.
- Efficient teamwork
---
# Chapter 2: The solution
---
## The Zettelkasten method.
### Components:
- Atomic notes:  atomic and self-contained.
- *context*-independent
- Links between notes.
	- For organization 
	- For navigation
	- For recall
	- Are a form of knowledge in themselves.

---
## Resilience to context-switching.
- Plurality of organizational structures. (make a graph here)

Organizational structures = contexts.

---
# Chapter 3: Pitfals
---
## Folders
- Folders: choose a single organization tree (a.k.a. choose a single context). 
- Tags/links/collections: choose many.
---
## Organizational rabbit hole
Sometimes the haters are right
- Up-front cost can be too high (heard of Julia?)
- Manual organizational work: minimize it!
- Example: logging your work time manually into excel.
---
## "Not clean enough to write down"
Reduce your good-enough standards. Notes are never too...
- Disorganized: brainstorms
- Short: Single-sentence notes.
Learn through writing!

---
## Latex notes
Does not separate
- Content writing, and
- Formatting.
---
## "I did my note-taking. Now let's write the paper in overleaf."
This is a context switch! Re-use first drafts in final products.

~~Note-taking~~ $\to$ Graph-based writing.

Have I mentioned a certain plugin?

---
# Okay, How?
---
## Enters: Obsidian
- Markdown files: no vendor lock-in. Efficient storage, future-proof, versioning.
- Rich plugin ecosystem.
---
## Core features
- Command pannel
- Quick switcher.
- Linking (with header and display)
- Figures.
- Tags: role of tags.
- Longforms and embeds.
---
## Tags
- Links are a generalization of tags.
- Use to describe the *type* of note instead of the *content* (controversial).
---
## Folder structure
- Files
- References
- "Notes" or "Zettelkasten"
- Templates
---
# Settings
1. Settings -> Files and Links -> Default location for new notes: set it to "Notes" or "Zettelkasten".
2. Settings -> Files and Links -> Default location for new attachments: "In the folder specified below": Set to "Files".
---
## Workshop first part: create a graph of notes
- Create the specified graph and organize it by project and content.
- Use composer to extract a heading.
- Use composer to merge nodes of the graph.
- Rename a note.
- Make a canvas and set up the graph there.
- Make a longform through embeds.
- Set a hotkey: Settings -> Hotkey. Set "Toggle to reading view" to Cmd+E.
- Change your theme: Settings -> Options -> Appearance -> Themes. Mine: ITS Theme

## Set up some workflows!
- [[Setup citations]]
- [[Setup home note and dataview]]
- [[Setup latex suite]]
- [[Setup quarto]]
- [[Setup vim]]
- [[Setup paper export]]
