# Abstract
What is the best way to structure a research workflow that will maximize
efficiency and satisfaction? That would be the Zettelkasten method, a system
where notes (markdown files) are organised through linking rather than folders.
I give my own take on this popular system and how I use it everyday to conduct
research in mathematics and write papers. This simple method, coupled with a
good understanding and good tools, has a surprising number of benefits, and has
the potential to speed up and improve your research from brainstorms all the
way to published papers. The workshop will proceed as follows: first I will
show what a Zettelkasten workflow looks like by showcasing my own network of
notes that I have been building for three years now. Then I will give my
understanding of the ideas and principle undergirding this method and the
reasons it is inherently more efficient than tranditional folder-based,
word-based or overleaf-based methods of writing. The last part of the workshop
will be the hands-on part of the workshop. You will try out Obsidian on your
own computer. It is a popular markdown editor specialized for this kind of
workflow. I will guide you through its core features, best practices and setting 
up crucial plugins that will bring your work to the next level.
