That would be the Zettelkasten method, a system where notes (markdown files) are organised through linking rather than folders. I give my own take on this popular system and how I use it everyday to conduct research in mathematics and write papers. This simple method, coupled with a good understanding and good tools, has a surprising number of benefits, and has the potential to speed up and improve your research from brainstorms all the way to published papers. The workshop will proceed as follows: first I will show what a Zettelkasten workflow looks like by showcasing my own network of notes that I have been building for three years now. Then I will give my understanding of the ideas and principle undergirding this method and the reasons it is inherently more efficient than tranditional folder-based, word-based or overleaf-based methods of writing. The last part of the workshop will be the hands-on part of the workshop. You will try out Obsidian on your own computer. It is a popular markdown editor specialized for this kind of workflow. I will guide you through its core features, best practices and setting  up crucial plugins that will bring your work to the next level.</p>"},{"location":"Recommended%20Plugins/","title":"Recommended Plugins","text":"<p>Back to the menu.</p>"},{"location":"Recommended%20Plugins/#recommended-plugins","title":"Recommended Plugins","text":""},{"location":"Recommended%20Plugins/#for-writing-latex","title":"For writing LaTex","text":"<ul> <li>Latex suite: snippets to write faster.</li> <li>Extended Mathjax: Enable user-defined latex commands globally.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Recommended%20Plugins/#highly-reccomended","title":"Highly reccomended","text":"<ul> <li>Omnisearch: adjust hotkeys.</li> <li>Breadcrumbs: track lemmas. %%make this a workflow?%%</li> <li>Zotero integration.</li> <li>Canvas</li> <li>Dataview: home note and preamble with templater.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Recommended%20Plugins/#very-good","title":"Very good","text":"<ul> <li>Plugins(Very good)<ul> <li>Obsidian vimrc.</li> <li>Collaborate with github (not a plugin, just a good idea).</li> </ul> </li> <li>Plugin (Specialized)<ul> <li>Excalidraw: hand-writing, graphs with links to your vault.</li> <li>Desmos</li> <li>Templater: Automatic template inserting associated with folders.</li> <li>Tasks: Many features to fetch and organize tasks</li> <li>Calendar and Periodic notes.</li> <li>Linter</li> <li>Chatgpt and copilot (many such plugins).</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Workflows/","title":"Obsidian technical setup","text":"<p>Back to the menu.</p>"},{"location":"Workflows/#workflows","title":"Workflows","text":"<ul> <li>The basics</li> <li>Setup citations</li> <li>Setup daily notes for journaling and navigation</li> <li>Setup home note with dataview</li> <li>Setup latex suite</li> <li>[[Obsidian Math Paper Writing Plugin]]</li> <li>Setup quarto</li> <li>Setup tasks</li> <li>Setup vim keybindings</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Workshop%20slides/","title":"Workshop slides","text":"<p>%%Menu, Workflows%%</p>"},{"location":"Workshop%20slides/#but-why","title":"But why?","text":""},{"location":"Workshop%20slides/#just-do-the-work-not-the-workflow","title":"\"Just do the work, not the workflow\"","text":""},{"location":"Workshop%20slides/#addressing-the-haters","title":"Addressing the haters","text":"<ul> <li>Up-front cost for recurring returns; avoid repetitive organizational work.</li> <li>Automated organizational work.</li> <li>Existence of free productivity improvements.to extract a</li> <li>Frictionless work is fun!</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Workshop%20slides/#guiding-principles","title":"Guiding principles","text":"maximize writing quality and quantity s.t.
